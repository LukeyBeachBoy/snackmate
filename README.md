### Features
Snackmate is a new recipe web app that aims to provide you with healthy and nutritious recipes
so you can spend less time thinking and more time eating.

#### Nutrition
Our focus is on making the nutritional value of our user-submitted recipes clearly visible, 
simply take a look at the calories or macronutrients of any recipe and you'll know if it can fit into
your diet. This data is all generated automatically thanks to the help of Nutritionix!

#### Social
Made a banging meal and want to share it with your vegan pals? With Snackmate all your recipes can be viewed
by anyone, either by them seeing it on their feed, or your can directly share your meal to your friends!
You can also leave a like or a comment on other member's recipes to let them know what you think.

#### Easy Recipe Builder
At Snackmate, we get out of your way and let you get straight to putting your ideas out for other people to see.
Our custom recipe builder lets you rapidly enter all the ingredients and steps to recreating your amazing meal, while
alerting you to any potential allergens your food contains. Cool right?

Snackmate is currently under development as a final year project at the University of Kent.
